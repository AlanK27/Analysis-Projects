We would like to find out if there are any trend or predictors we can identify
by plotting different types of attributes together.


# Heatmap of Race and Area
Heat map describing the area where accident happens the most categorized 
by race. From the chart Hispanic have an overall high rate of accidents
compared to all other races. For Asians and Blacks the accidents
appears to concentrate on only certain areas while White have a somewhat
even distribution.


# Monthly data with moving average
Here we have the numbers for monthly accidents over the span of several years.
The moving average is also plotting with an increase starting around 2015.
This might be due to a law that was put into effect or some particular changes
which can be identified by digging deeper into the data set.


# Number of accidents per year
This is the number of accidents per day. Similar to the monthly data there 
is a clear trend as accidents starting to increases around 2015. 


# Race and Age data
Box plot of age vs race, displaying variation for these data. The median 
age is around the same for all race. From earlier Hispanics show the most
accidents but also it has the most outliers. There does not appear to be much 
variation for most race with the exception of Hispanics and Unknown category.

From these plots it seems fitting cluster could be problematic due to the
small variations for White, Asian, and Black. Separation could be done separating 
Hispanics against others using classifier models such as SVM, Random Forest.
Otherwise if the predictor is to categorize race then its better to use K Means Clustering.
